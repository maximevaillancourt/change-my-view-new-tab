# /r/changemyview on New Tab page

**Growth mindset folks, this one's for you.** Holding (too) strongly to your beliefs is bad and you should feel bad. Instead, challenge your own beliefs and opinions everytime you open a new browser window, and discover how other human beings view our world.

The extension will randomly display a top post from [/r/changemyview](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/) (from the past 24 hours) and load its top comments. Unsatisfied with the displayed CMV entry? Simply reload the page (or open a new tab).
